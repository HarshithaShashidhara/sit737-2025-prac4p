Calculator Microservice
This is a simple calculator microservice built using Node.js, Express, and Winston for logging. The microservice supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Prerequisites
Node.js installed (v14+ recommended)

NPM installed

Installation
Clone the repository or create a new project directory.

Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

Run the following command to install dependencies:

npm install express winston

Running the Microservice
Start the server by running:

node server.js
The server will start on port 3050, and you should see a message:

info: Calculator microservice running at http://localhost:3050

You can perform arithmetic operations by making HTTP GET requests to the endpoints:

Addition:
curl "http://localhost:3050/add?num1=10&num2=5"
Response: {"operation":"add","result":15}

Subtraction:

curl "http://localhost:3050/subtract?num1=10&num2=5"
Response: {"operation":"subtract","result":5}

Multiplication:

curl "http://localhost:3050/multiply?num1=10&num2=5"
Response: {"operation":"multiply","result":50}

Division:

curl "http://localhost:3050/divide?num1=10&num2=5"
Response: {"operation":"divide","result":2}

Viewing Logs
Logs are stored in the logs directory. You can check the logs using:

For combined logs:

type logs\combined.log
For error logs:

type logs\error.log

Troubleshooting
If curl gives an error like The ampersand (&) character is not allowed, wrap the URL in double quotes.

If the server doesnâ€™t start, ensure port 3050 is free, or modify the port in server.js.

Stopping the Server
To stop the server, press CTRL + C in the terminal where it's running.
